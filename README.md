TwitchKlips is a project i designed for playing around with twitch's multiple APIs. It features React.js with a Redux architectural framework for it's front end and uses Twitch's API endpoints to display it's views.

### More API endpoints!

  To begin with, this was a fun project for playing around with twitch's api endpoints. I would love to possibly expand this app into a single page application and utilize some of their other APIs as well!
